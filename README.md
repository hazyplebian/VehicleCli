## Description

Vehicle Cli is a command-line application that allows users to create or select existing vehicles and interact with them through a series of actions. The app demonstrates object-oriented design and provides an engaging way to practice modifying and expanding an existing codebase.

Users can create different vehicle types including cars, trucks, and motorbikes, and perform various actions with each vehicle. This tool is ideal for developers looking to build and work with object classes while improving command-line interaction skills.
